---

## 🚀 START HERE

👉 **Open this file first**: `docs/EVIDENCE_COMMAND_CENTER.md`

That file is your **operational dashboard**. It will guide you through the entire process.

## What You're About to Do

You're going to **systematically collect visual and interaction evidence** proving that the portfolio meets all requirements from the Deep Space vNext specification and the STRICT Mode QA gate.

**Three deliverables**:
1. 20+ screenshots and videos (in `docs/screenshots/`)
2. Filled Evidence Pack template (in `docs/key_principles/`)
3. Validation that all npm checks pass

## Success Criteria

Evidence Pack is **COMPLETE** when:

- ✅ All 20+ files captured in `docs/screenshots/`
- ✅ All 15 checks documented in Evidence Pack
- ✅ All 9 required scenarios captured
- ✅ Link audit passes (0 placeholders, 0 404s)
- ✅ `npm run content:validate` passes
- ✅ `npm run build` passes
- ✅ Build info section completed
- ✅ Status marked FINAL

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Batch by type**: Do all dark screenshots first, then light, then videos (faster)
2. **Use shortcuts**: ⌘+Shift+3 (full) or ⌘+Shift+4 (selection) on macOS
3. **Record slowly**: Move slowly when recording so animations are visible
4. **Verify as you go**: Check each capture before moving to next
5. **Split windows**: Open CAPTURE_GUIDE + CHECKLIST side-by-side
6. **Keep backups**: After capturing, back up `docs/screenshots/` externally

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I actually start?**  
A: Open `EVIDENCE_COMMAND_CENTER.md` and follow the Quick Start Checklist

**Q: How much time will this take?**  
A: 2–3 hours total (including planning, capturing, documenting, validating)

**Q: Can I prioritize if I'm short on time?**  
A: Yes. See "Priority Captures" in EVIDENCE_REFERENCE_MATRIX.md (10 critical files = 80% coverage)

**Q: Do videos need audio?**  
A: NO. All videos must be SILENT. Record interactions only.

**Q: Can I use a real device instead of DevTools emulation?**  
A: YES. Both work. DevTools is faster; actual device is more realistic.

**Q: What if a feature doesn't exist?**  
A: Check Deep Space vNext spec Section 12 (Locked Decisions) for scope. Document as "N/A" if out of scope.

**Q: Can I do this in parallel?**  
A: YES. Capture desktop on your computer, mobile on device simultaneously.
