summary: "Pluggable, tech-agnostic metadata and data governance framework that unified scattered data assets."
---

## Context
Data assets were scattered across teams, with no single place for ownership, lineage, or documentation. Engineers lost time finding datasets and resolving data quality issues.

## Constraints
- Built as a side project with a small team on weekends.
- Needed to work across different stacks and storage systems.
- Adoption depended on low friction and clear value.

## What I built
- A metadata and cataloging layer for discovery and ownership.
- Lineage and versioned assets for traceability.
- A pluggable design so teams could integrate without rewrites.

## Impact
- Saved 400+ effort hours annually by reducing manual data discovery and bug triage.
- Became the first-priority platform initiative after an internal demo.

## Stack
Metadata services, lineage pipelines, UI and API surfaces, and integration connectors.
