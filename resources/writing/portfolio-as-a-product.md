## Executive summary
Deep Space treats a portfolio like a production product: clarity first, depth when asked. Every interaction is intentional, every surface has a role, and the content system keeps quality consistent over time.

## Why Deep Space
Data platforms are invisible until they fail. The space metaphor makes scale, gravity, and precision feel natural without distracting from the work.

## The interaction grammar
Every surface is either Navigate, Reveal, or Ambient. This removes guessing and makes the UI feel honest.

## Evidence-first storytelling
Claims are paired with proof: projects, writing, and measurable outcomes. Depth is available, but never forced.

## The build contract
Content lives in resources, and validation gates block placeholders and broken links. The definition of done includes QA and motion checks.

## What changes over time
Projects evolve, the stack shifts, and new writing appears. The system is built to adapt without eroding polish.
