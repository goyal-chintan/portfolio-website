# v2 Vision & Guiding Light (Rewrite)

## 1) The one sentence

Build a portfolio that feels like Apple shipped it: **quiet confidence, instrument‑grade interaction honesty, and deep systems thinking** expressed through a “Deep Space Observatory” metaphor.

## 2) What this product is (and is not)

### 2.1 It is

- A **signal amplifier**: “This person ships serious systems and can explain tradeoffs.”
- A **craft demonstration**: every motion and every pixel is intentional.
- A **maintainable system**: content updates are data changes, not code changes.
- A **recruiter‑fast, peer‑deep** funnel: 10 seconds for clarity, 5 minutes for depth.

### 2.2 It is not

- Not a playground of random UI tricks.
- Not a particle show.
- Not an encyclopedic list of everything ever used.

## 3) Target users (prioritized)

1) Recruiters / hiring managers (speed + clarity)  
2) Staff/CTO peers (depth + tradeoffs)  
3) Collaborators (taste + communication)  
4) Future “customer” (consulting/engagement readiness; optional, extensible)

## 4) v2 thesis: “Honest light”

In v1, users experienced “glow but nothing happens.” Apple would reject that immediately.

**v2 principle**: Light/glow/hover must be “honest”:
- If it glows like it can be clicked, it must do something (Navigate or Reveal).
- If it’s Ambient, it must not behave like a control.

## 5) Non‑negotiables (DoD blockers)

- **Zero dead clicks**: no surface may imply click and then do nothing.
- **Zero runtime overlays**: no Next.js red overlay; no React errors.
- **Zero broken links/assets**: no 404s; no placeholder URLs; no missing images.
- **One navigation model**: Deep Dive tabs for content; navbar for global actions only.
- **Motion is a system**: consistent easing/timing; no jank; no layout thrash.
- **Accessibility is real**: keyboard, focus, contrast, reduced motion.

## 6) Success criteria (measurable outcomes)

### Recruiter (10 seconds)
- Can answer: who you are, what you do, proof at scale, what to click next.
- Primary CTA is obvious and singular.

### Peer (60 seconds)
- Can see: your “favorite” systems work, your mental models, your standards.
- Can find at least 2–3 proofs of depth (writing + project brief + resume).

### Craft (product feel)
- Interactions are discoverable and consistent.
- Theme change feels like “night → morning” (calm, no flash).
- No element feels “template-y”.

## 7) v2 “North Star” mental model

The site is a **Deep Space Observatory**:
- Home = “mission control”
- Deep Dive = “instruments”
- Stack = “constellations” of capability (lens, not filter)
- Spotlight project = “mission brief”
